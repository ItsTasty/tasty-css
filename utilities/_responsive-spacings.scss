/**
 * Utility classes enhancing the normal spacing classes by adding responsiveness
 * to them. By default, there are not responsive spacings defined. You can
 * generate responsive spacings by adding entries to the following three Sass
 * maps, e.g.:
 *
 *   $tasty-responsive-spacing-directions: (
 *     null: null,
 *     "-bottom": "-bottom",
 *   );
 *
 *   $tasty-responsive-spacing-properties: (
 *     "margin": "margin",
 *   );
 *
 *   $tasty-responsive-spacing-sizes: (
 *     "-small": $tasty-global-spacing-unit-small,
 *   );
 *
 * This would bring us the following classes:
 *
 *   .u-margin-small@mobile {}
 *   .u-margin-small@tablet {}
 *   .u-margin-small@desktop {}
 *   .u-margin-small@wide {}
 *   .u-margin-bottom-small@mobile {}
 *   .u-margin-bottom-small@tablet {}
 *   .u-margin-bottom-small@desktop {}
 *   .u-margin-bottom-small@wide {}
 *
 * You can change the generated CSS classes by further extending the Sass maps.
 * If you want every ‘normal’ spacing (those from `utilities.spacings`) also as
 * a responsive version, you can just mirror the ‘normal’ spacings:
 *
 *   $tasty-responsive-spacing-directions: $tasty-spacing-directions !default;
 *
 *   $tasty-responsive-spacing-properties: $tasty-spacing-properties !default;
 *
 *   $tasty-responsive-spacing-sizes: $tasty-spacing-sizes !default;
 *
 * BUT BE AWARE: This can generate a huge chunk of extra CSS, depending on the
 * amount of breakpoints you defined. So please check your CSS’ output and
 * filesize!

// The responsive spacings just make sense and work properly when the ‘normal’
// spacings are included, too. In case they're not, we set `_utilities.spacings`

  // in the class name. By default, we are generating the responsive suffixes
  // for the classes with a `@` symbol so you get classes like:
  //
  //   <div class="u-margin-bottom@mobile">
  //
  // Be aware that since the `@` symbol is a reserved symbol in CSS, it has to be
  // escaped with a `\`. In the markup though, you write your classes without the
  // backslash (e.g. `u-margin-bottom@mobile`).
